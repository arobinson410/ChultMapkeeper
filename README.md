<h3> An unfficial tool for Dungeon Masters running the Tomb of Annihilation hex crawl. </h3>
<p> As a new DM and avid programmer, I wanted to bring my game of Tomb of Annihilation into the 21st century and use visual aids dispalyed on a television. To my surprise, there was not a single mapping tool for the hex crawl, so I created my own.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>.NET Framework 4.7.2</li>
</ul>
<h2> How to Use </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use the 'M' key to drag and zoom on the map</li>
  <li>Use the 'H' key to reveal a hex. You can click the space the hex occupied to hide it again.</li>
  <li>Use the 'P' key to move the party indicator (the little warrior). The hex snapping is a bit wonky, but mostly functional.</li>
  <li>A file called "saved" is generated in the same directory as the executable when you close the program. This is your saved map and party location.
</ul>
